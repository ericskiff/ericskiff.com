# Treasure DAO - Story

## Chapter 1
“You cant think you’re actually going to find it.”

“Maybe I do, maybe I don’t” Savannah said, as she hefted the bag of tools into her trunk. Her bright red hair swung over her face, and she blew it away with a huff. “And we’ve been over this a dozen times. You can come if you want, but you can’t stop me from going. This is my last chance to do something crazy, and I’m taking it. 

Jamie stood there looking at her friend as she loaded her trunk with more and more gear. The tent, the radios, the pickaxe. 

“You’re actually bringing a pickaxe? You look like a cartoon. Should I go get your headlamp and canteen.?” Jamie said with a sneer. 

“Ha. Ha.” Savanah retorted. “And anyway, they’re already in my bag”

“Oh my god, savannah, you’ve officially gone off the deep end here”

“So what? Maybe I have. Maybe I’m chasing some crazy treasure that doesn’t even exist. Maybe this will all amount to nothing and I’ll go to school in September with nothing to show for it, but what would I have if I stayed? Another summer of working at minimum-wage-filet?… Jamie, I want to see the country. I want to do something different. I want to get out of this damn town.”

“And you think I’m lame for wanting to stay.” Jamie said, her true feelings showing through. 

Savannah looked over at her friend. She wanted to be angry, but she saw how sad she looked. She took a deep breath and walked over to her, pulling her into an embrace.

“No. You know I don’t… it’s just different for you. You’ve got your family, and the job at the library, and whatever it is that’s going on with you and Jeremy from the coffeeshop”

“What? The coffeeshop guy? There’s nothing going on with us?” Jamie stammered, suddenly speaking very fast. “Why, do you think there’s something going on with us? Oh my god savannah do you think he likes me?”

Savannah just laughed. 

“Hey, that was mean, you’re trying to distract me” Jamie continued, realizing.

“I think you’re distracted enough yourself. But seriously, you have so much going on here, you’re going to have a great summer. And I…”

“You just see everything you’ve lost”

This time it was Savannah’s turn to look sad. She looked up at her friend, and resumed hefting stuff into her trunk.

“Listen” Jamie continued. “I know it hasn’t been easy since…” She trailed off. They never talked about what happened to Savannah’s dad. It was just sort of understood that they didn’t bring it up. Now didn’t feel like the time to go prying. “I just want you to know that I’m still here for you. Even…. Even if I can’t come with you”

“I know you are. I think it’s part of the reason I feel strong enough to go. I know that we’ll always be best friends. This is just for a few months.”

“Okay. Promise me you’ll be safe?”

“I promise I’ll write. How’s that?” Savanah said. 

“You’d better. Besides, you’re not going to solve this without a scooby-doo gang backing you up. Who else do you know with a library full of books and bored nerds who love puzzles?” Jamie quipped, smiling again. 


Savannah laughed and closed the hatchback of her car, kicking up dust from the dirt driveway. She took one last look at burnt grass and dilapidated porch on her father’s house, it’s shutters drawn, knowing she had locked the doors behind her. It was her house now she guessed, but she couldn’t deal with that right now. She needed to get out of here, and today was the day. 

“Text me when you hit Atlanta?” Jamie said

“You got it. And Jamie… Thanks for always being there for me”

“We’ll always be there for each other. Just don’t forget me when you’re a rich treasure hunter”

Savannah laughed once more and hugged her friend again. Tears began to slip from her eyes, and she turned and got into her car before she lost her nerve. 

Jamie stood watching the dust rise as her friend drove down the path towards the road, the blazing summer sun lighting it up like a plume of fire against the horizon. 

## CHAPTER 2

"Eye-ha-ii-eay! Am a man, of constant sorrow" Savannah sang along to the old-timey music coming from her car's stereo as she drove down the winding two lane highway. 

She smiled as she felt the wind blow her hair around and the heat of the sun on the side of her face. It was hot, but the wind felt good and she'd been getting tired on the last leg of her drive. 

She'd never been through this part of Georgia before. Or any part of Georgia, really, except for that one time they stopped over in the Atlanta airport on a flight to NYC. 

It was years ago, she must've been 5 or 6, and she and her dad had been flying out to meet her mom's family. They couldn't exactly afford the flight so they'd had a few layovers on the way from Phoenix. Savannah hadn't really minded though, and she had fond memories of that trip. Her dad was still big and healthy back then, and her Aunts in the city had doted on her and let her play with her old toys while the adults talked. 

There were lots of moments like that - glimpses of kindness and fun and normality, while the adults talked about estates and executors and trusts. Savannah didn't know enough back then to really follow it, but it was all making more sense now that she'd hand to handle some of it after her dad passed.

Her mom and dad hadn't been married, and they weren't really even friendly when her mom got sick. Her mom's will had named Savannah as sole inheritor, but she put it all in a trust with her Aunt as executor. It provided some help for her and her dad while she was growing up, but they couldn't touch most of it until she turned 18, which she still wouldn't do until September. 

Savannah's thoughts veered darker as she thought about the last few years, and how much that money would have helped her dad. Maybe if things were different he might've done better. Maybe he'd still be here. 

She took a deep breath and shook those thoughts out of her head. No use wallowing in it. She thought about all the times her dad had told her about this crypto treasure that everyone had forgotten, and how he was working on cracking it. He'd shown her the strange symbolic writing, the cypher system, and how he'd cracked the code. 

He explained the clues and how he thought they fit together, and then he'd read her The Odyssey  (at least the first few chapters before she got bored) and made her watch O' Brother Where Art Thou and all the rest of the Coen brother's movies "just in case." Secretly, Savannah thought he just loved those movies.

After a while, so did she. 

Now, they felt like a bright, hot connection to her dad, and so did this treasure hunt. 

"We're going to find it dad, you and me."

Savannah started to sing along again, feeling that sun on her face and smiling once more. 

Finally, as the sun started to get lower in the sky, Savannah pulled off the highway, down some local roads, and up into a campsite.

She stretched as she got out of the car, and then walked down the trail to where the trees cleared. 

"Here we are" she said to no one as she came through into the clearing. As she walked through, she could see the lake, and the sunset reflecting off it. It was huge. The lake looked like an ocean from this point of view, and it seemed to go on forever, with giant arms snaking in the the forest around her. 

![](ericskiff_a_red-haired_teenage_woman_in_camping_attire_looks_ou_17242cae-2af8-4942-beaa-948a414ec1b7.png)

“Whoa” she said as she took it in. It was beautiful, but it was massive. She realized for the first time that she’d followed all the clues here, but now she had no idea where to look. She didn't know what she was expecting, maybe some little pond with a wishing well or a little island she could go dig up? She suddenly felt very small, and very lost. 

She found a place to perch on a big rock and sat for a while, taking in the view, and finally felt the dam break inside her.  
 
What was she doing? How could she possibly think this would work? It wasn't going to bring her dad back, and she had no idea what to do next now that she'd gotten here. What if he wasn't even right with his crazy theories?

For the first time since the night her dad passed, with no one around to see, Savannah wept. 

Finally, as the sun settled beneath the trees, she wiped her cheeks, took a deep breath, and pulled out her phone, and videocalled Jamie. 

"Hey there explorer" Jamie greeted her, happily. 

Savannah laughed, but kind of burp-sobbed one final time as she did. She put her hand to her mouth and Jamie realized. 

"Oh honey" Jamie said, "What can I do. Are you okay?"

"Yeah" Savannah said, trying to smile through her tears "I'm sorry, it's stupid, I just... It's a lot" 

"I can't even imagine. But you're there though?"

"Yeah, I'm here" Savannah said, and she flipped her camera to look out at the lake and the orange-red sunset streaking over the trees. 

"Whoa. That's amazing" Jamie said, taking in the scene "But also... kind of ginormous? That's definitely not what I was picturing"

"I know. That's what's hitting me. I'm just realizing how big this all is. I don't even know where to start." Savannah said, feeling the lump rise in her throat again.

"Okay, it's okay, we can figure this out, we're just going to take it step by step. Let's go over the clues again." 

## CHAPTER 3

“Let’s start at the top” Jamie said, her voice sounding tinny and chipper over speakerphone, as she was currently propped up in the corner of Savannah’s tent. 

“This begins your odyssey” Savannah began reciting the riddle that she knew by heart, but Jamie stopped her

“No no” Jamie interrupted “Let’s go all the way back. Maybe we’ve missed something”

“Okay, all the way back?” Savannah said as she unpacked her gear. 

“All the way” 

“All right, in 2022, at the height of the 2nd crypto wave and the NFT craze, DAOs were just starting out and people were doing weird stuff with them. Most folks didn’t even have a wallet yet and it was still kind of this niche thing. At that time crypto apps were mostly DeFi, lending pools and stuff, but also some weird shared ownership things, games, and more complex contracts. Basically a lot of young tech people suddenly had too much money and a new toy to play with."

"Which brings us to TreasureDAO" Jamie chimed in.

"Right. Some rich crypto-bro calling himself Captain Flint decides they want to distribute the wealth and have some fun doing it, so they set up a treasure hunt system. They created the DAO and the rules of the game, and then made a few starter puzzles and put prizes inside them. If you wanted to hunt the treasure, you had to pay an entry fee"

"How'd you pay the fee?" Jamie asked, with a smile creeping into her voice. 

"With the Binary Utility for Treasure Interaction" Savannah deadpanned, glaring back at Jamie. 

Jamie was grinning now, she loved teasing Savannah when she could. "What's its real name" she asked. 

"Ugh, Fine. BUTI. Fees and rewards are paid in BUTI." Savannah answered, rolling her eyes. 

Jamie was practically dancing in her chair "eee, I love it! It's so stupid!" 

"Don't make me say it again" Savannah said

"Arrr matey, yeh gottah pay me booty to hunt me treasure" Jamie added in pirate voice. 

“Okay okay, that’s plenty me heartie” Savannah shot back with a wry smile “anyway, a few folks played along and then someone found the first puzzle and it kinda took off. Suddenly there were hundreds of puzzles, and the price of BUTI took off. It was around then that the Big One was created.”

“One million BUTI” Jamie said in her pirate voice from the phone

“Right, worth about a hundred thousand dollars at the time. Suddenly everyone was hunting it, and the price of BUTI and the total prize kept creeping up as they entered, adding their entry fees to the pool.” Said Savannah, as she started to unload her dinner from her pack. 

“But no one ever found it” Jamie said

“Yup, about 6 months later the crash started, and the market just kept sliding down, taking crypto with it for a while. BUTI dropped to a few cents and never really recovered. By the time Bitcoin and Ether stabilized, everyone had forgotten about it and moved on.” Savannah said, plugging her small electric stove in the battery pack at the edge of the tent. The display showed 74% power, still mostly charged from before she set out, but she knew it would start recharging from the solar panels she’d propped up outside in the morning.

“Everyone except your dad” Jamie said, prodding Savannah along in the tale.

“Everyone except my dad” Savannah said with a sigh. “He’d sunk a good amount of cash into BUTI at the top, thinking it was going to moon, and it really messed up his plans when it all crashed. He never bought back in when things started to recover and…” Savannah trailed off. “Anyway, when it was all said and done, all he had was his stash of worthless BUTI and an obsession with solving The Big One”

“But it’s not just one puzzle right?” Jamie said. They hadn’t really talked about this much, but she’d done enough reading about TreasureDAO to get the basics.

“Yup, all the puzzles come in random groups of three, grouped by difficulty and prize level. It was set up that way to prevent cheating by solving your own puzzles or having someone do it for you. Even if you cheated at your own, you’d have to solve two just as hard to win.” Savannah explained

“So why’d your dad think he could solve it?” Jamie asked

“Well, he could never afford to take the time off to go on the hunt, but as far as he could tell, he was the only one to ever crack the text cypher on The Big One, and then he started to put together the clues. He always said if he could solve that one, every other puzzle in the DAO was cake in comparison. He just needed to solve the first and the next two would click, and he’d get his payout”

“But why keep obsessing over it if BUTI was worth pennies?” Jamie asked

“Well, it wasn’t always just BUTI hidden in the puzzle. Sometimes puzzle makers included bonuses like private wallets with some NFTs or Ether. They didn’t have to, but The Big One was made by the original DAO creator, Captain Flint himself, and he always did. And the rumor was that the missing Bored Ape was in one of his Wallets.”

“Oh damn” Jamie said. “Those are still worth a bunch right? You never told me about that”

“Yeah, not as much as they were, but it’s like 100-200k even still. Maybe more with its history. Of course it’s still just conjecture. “ Savannah said, sounding dismissive. “Anyway, my dad had this theory that when he cracked The Big One, that at least something extra would be included. When people caught wind of it, he figured the price of BUTI would pop back up as newbies bought in to search for other treasures to see what else in them. Even if he didn’t solve the other two, he could sell some of his stash and then, well, things would be better for us.”

They were silent for a bit as Savannah was lost in thought. Eventually Jamie broke the silence.

“So how far did he get” 

“Well, he got me here, if here is even the right place.” Savannah said. “Once he cracked the clue’s text cypher it read:

This begins your odyssey 
Do not seek the treasure
For it sleeps under the man
Who would not sit down
And railed against change
He could only slow but never stop
While it flowed like him
Like the river
Then swallowed him whole

“Right” Jamie said. “So, how’d that get you to Clarks Hill Lake”

“The beginning is an obvious reference to the old Cohen Brothers movie O’ Brother Where Art Thou. It’s a remake of Homer’s Odyssey, and one of the characters literally yells “do not seek the tray-sure!” in it” Savannah said, over-enunciating the line, just like the movie she’d watched with her dad a dozen times.

“Ok, so we’ve got the movie” Jamie prodded her along

“Right, and the plot of the movie has them seeking a treasure of their own in a town which is about to be flooded as they make way for a dam and new lake”

“And that’s in Georgia?” Jamie asked

“No. That’s the weird part. As far as my dad could tell, the lake in the movie and the sunken town were fictional. The movie is set in deep Mississippi, but he couldn’t find any towns that were swamped by dams or otherwise sunken.”

“So what about the rest of the clue”

“It’s all pretty opaque - the man who would not sit down and railed against change” and all that. So my dad started looking for anything that might match a man-made lake to something like that, and eventually he found out that Lake Clark used to be called Lake Strom Thurmond.

“I know I should know who that is. It sounds familiar” Jamie said.

“Right, it’s a name you’ve heard, but it’s not like we studied him in school, so I had to look it up to understand the connection. At first it seems like, oh, here’s this guy who was the longest serving senator, how nice that they named the lake after him. Then you dig in, and you realize what a massive a-hole this guy was.”

“Ohhh, yeah. I’m reading his Wikipedia now. This guy holds literally holds the record for being the worst. Actually, he’s got a few of them” Jamie said

“Seriously” Savannah said, taking a bite of her dinner, which was surprisingly not bad for camping food. “He has the record for longest standing filibuster, holding up the entire workings of the senate, and for what?”

“To stop the civil rights act” Jamie said, her hand half over her mouth. “Oh, Savannah, what are you mixed up in”

“I had that same thought!” Savannah exclaimed. ”Am I down some alt-right rabbit hole here? But then I thought about the clue, and things started to make sense.”

Jamie recited the end of the clue from the phone.
“For it sleeps under the man
Who would not sit down
And railed against change
He could only slow but never stop
While it flowed like him
Like the river
Then swallowed him whole”

Savannah took a deep breath. It all still made sense, and now that she was explaining it to Jamie, she was becoming even more sure of herself, and of her Father’s solution to the puzzle. 

Jamie spoke first

“Savannah, I think your dad might have actually solved this.”

“I know. The more I think about it, the more it all fits. The man who wouldn’t sit down has the record for the longest standing filibuster. He railed against change by fighting the civil rights movement and against equal rights at nearly every step of his career. And then there was a sunken town under a lake named after him. It’s gotta be here”

“The question is” Jamie said “Where”

“Where.” Savannah echoed. “And the lake is a lot bigger than I was expecting. I don’t even know where to start.”

“Well” Jamie said “if we know the clue is all about this crusty old shitbird, it stands to reason that the next part of the puzzle is somehow linked to him as well.  Tomorrow we’ll start from the top, checking out everything and anything related to him at the lake.”

“Right, I just need to break this down into simpler pieces. I made it there, and now I’ve got you helping me. We can figure this out”

“Damn right we can. We’re going to solve this mystery, and then the ghost of that old senator’s going to come out wearing a sheet and he’ll be like “ah, I would have gotten away with it, if it weren’t for you meddling kids and your pesky civil rights” 

Savannah laughed, and then thought for a moment. “Oh, I just realized that joke is probably darker than you meant it”

“Oh no, that’s straight up where I was going with that.” Jamie deadpanned, and Savannah laughed again. 

Their laughter echoed out into the clear night air and over the still water of the lake. Savannah took a deep breath and thought about her friend, where she was, and what she was doing. She was going to be okay. Tonight she would laugh and talk with her friend, and then sleep. 

Tomorrow, she would start her search. 


### Chapter 4

The air over the parking lot shimmered.  waving with the intense heat of the summer Georgia sun as Savannah pulled her car into the parking lot of the visitor’s center. 

She’d spend the morning mapping out a few spots to check and breaking down her campsite, and now she was at her first destination. 

As she stepped out of her car, she felt the heat of the air like a punch in the face. She could smell the asphalt baking in the sun as she walked to the edge of the parking lot and looked out at the the vista. The scale of the lake and the dam still surprised her. She’d thought maybe it would take her a day or two to work her way around the lake and look for interesting landmarks, but the shoreline of the lake wound around for over 1200 miles. She could search all summer and never explore all of it. 

Instead, she and Jamie decided to start with the obvious spots - anything that referenced the history of the area, especially anything about Thurmond. 

The lake and dam had been quietly renamed back to “Clark Hill” around 2030, but the parks department was still getting around to changing out all the places where the old name appeared. 

Savannah could still see the darkened outline of “Thurmond Dam” on the sun-bleached wall of the visitor center, behind the new Clark Hill Dam lettering. 

There were only a few other visitors in the place, and Savannah wandered around, looking for anything that might be a clue or related to Thurmond. Her ears perked up as a film reel started up from one of the semi-darkened rooms. 

“Originally completed in 1953, the Thurmond Dam provides clean hydroelectric power to thousands of households throughout the southeastern United States and prevents millions of dollars in flood damage each year. Lake Strom Thurmond is the 10th most visited civil…”

Savannah stopped listening and started to look around the darkened room. She was alone, and looked around for anything that could be a hint or some kind of artifact. 

She climbed up on the armrests of two of the chairs and reached up to wave her phone near the projector showing the old video. Captain Flint was known for hiding clues in NFC tags at physical locations, all you had to do was get close enough with your phone and the URL would appear. 

Nothing showed up on Savannah’s phone, and she climbed down, frustrated. She looked around for a QR code, secret message, or anything that could lead her in the right direction. 

Finally, she sat and watched the propaganda reel twice through, grasping onto a hope that something had been hidden in the video, but the fact that it was playing off a DVD and looked like it had been produced before the turn of the millennium didn’t give her much confidence.

She spent the rest of the afternoon pouring over the visitors center, hoping for any sign. She learned more about man made lakes, how Americans love water recreation, and just how big the damn thing was than she ever wanted to know. 

More than once, a helpful employee had wandered over to her, happy to have an interested visitor doing more than dragging their kids through before heading off to their vacation rental. 

She got the distinct impression that at least one of the employees was particularly happy to have a young, female visitor, and she tried to keep her distance without seeming rude as his smile and gaze got steadily creepier. 

Savannah finally gave up her search indoors, and stepped back out into the summer heat. The sun was lower in the sky now, casting beautiful rays down through the clouds, and Savannah found herself marveling at how beautiful it actually was. 

She hadn’t gone on many trips with her dad, but when they’d gotten away it had usually been to some campsite or nature walk, and she’d gotten her appreciation for nature from him. She could truly be happy with a little cabin someplace and a view like this. 

Savannah dialed Jamie from the scenic overlook, but when she didn’t pick up, she realized that Jamie was probably at work. She hung up the call and shot off a few texts

`SAVANNAH: spent the day exploring the visitor’s center. Hit a few spots that I thought might be promising, but came up with nothing.`

`SAVANNAH: Going to keep exploring, but it looks like this might be a bust. Gotta figure out where to head next`

Savannah looked back out at the sun streaked sky and walked along the overlook towards the dam. She noticed a plaque with a picture of the dam on it and went over to read it. 

Just then her phone dinged with a new text

`JAMIE: Aww, sorry you didn’t find anything at the visitor’s center. @work til’ 8, will call you then.`

As Savannah read the text from her friend, she noticed a second notification on her phone. 

`NFC Nearby: IPFS://v8234mn4k3.234k48.9xt`[open]

Savannah’s heart skipped a beat. Was this it? There was an NFC tag somewhere nearby, with an IPFS url, for some file stored on the blockchain. This had to be it. 

She looked at the raised copper plaque emblazoned  “J. Strom Thurmond Dam”  and it was certainly old enough to have been here when The Big One was hidden, and she ducked down under the sign to see if she could find the tag. 

Sure enough, there was a small plastic case held in place by two small screws, looking a bit weathered and cracked, but holding on tight.  

Suddenly Savannah was nervous. Should she click the link? What if she didn’t know what to do next.

She took a breath and clicked. 

Her browser wouldn’t open the URL and gave her some error about a protocol. 

Feeling frantic now, Savannah searched “how to open IPFS URL” and came up with a few apps in the App Store. She installed some free blockchain enabled browser and tried the link again. This time it opened in the new app, and a page appeared. 

All it had was a black pirate flag and a prompt that said 

`Password: (This begins your _______)” `

Savannah screamed and started jumping up and down, electric with the excitement of finding it. 

She shot off a text to Jamie `SAVANNAH: Omgomg I just found it. There’s something here at the sign`

She flipped back to the explorer app and focused on the password field, and quickly started to type “odissey”, and then backed it out. That wasn’t right. “oddessey” no, that wasn’t it. Ugh. 

She flipped once more to her notes app where she had her dad’s puzzle notes, and muttered to herself “o d y? No wonder it looked wrong. Weird ass word.” She said as she selected the word directly from the text and copied it, and then finally pasted it into the password prompt. 

She hit the submit button and the page changed. Savannah screamed again. 

She’d done it! She’d tracked down he clues her dad had left her, made it to the right place, and somehow stumbled upon the physical clue left hiding there 17 years ago. 

She texted Jamie again `SAVANNAH: YES! It’s for real, I just entered a password and got in. Reading now`

Savannah flipped back to the page, and finally started to read. It had a pirate theme, and there was a map with a pinpoint location somewhere in the lake. 

“Congratulations on making it this far. If you’re reading this page, you’ve  used your mind to solve my cryptogram, and you’ve adventured out to find my clue. Now you must build your way to the final treasure, and be quick, other adventurers are likely close behind.”

Savannah laughed to herself. She was pretty sure no one else was hot on her heels at this point. 

“The treasure, like this town, lies deep below the waters, and the location here is but a starting point. To find it without dredging half the lake, you’ll need to build yourself a helper. Plans are attached, but feel free to get creative. Simply get close enough to read the tag, and the treasure will be revealed “

Savannah’s phone rang, she saw Jamie’s name and quickly answered

“WHAT!?” Jamie screamed from the handset

“I KNOW!” Savannah yelled back

“Okay okay, tell me everything, what have you got, are you rich?” Jamie said, trying to keep her voice down in the library, where she was hiding among the stacks to call Savannah

“No, at least not yet. There’s a 3rd part to this puzzle. Apparently the final treasure is sunken beneath the lake” Savannah responded, starting to lose some of the edge of her excitement now that she realized there was more to do. 

“No! How are you going to get down there, that lake’s, like, deep right?” Jamie said

“Yeah, 180 feet at it’s deepest point.” Savannah said. “Don’t ask how i know that, I just spent a day getting intimate with some very boring lake facts”

Jamie laughed. “So what are you going to do?”

“Well, there’s some kind of final challenge here. I’ve got a location in the lake somewhere where I’m supposed to start looking, but it says I’m going to have to build a helper, and that plans are attached” Savannah said

“Okay, pull them up!” Jamie exclaimed, getting excited now. They were on the hunt!

“Let’s see, download PDF. Okay, I’m opening it, and… Jamie, these are plans for a submarine.”

“For real? Like “ Jamie made a siren sounds and then half yelled “DIVE DIVE!” And it was Savannah’s turn to laugh

“Ha ha, no I think it’s too small for that. It looks like this is kind of an underwater drone. There’s a bunch of X3D and STL files attached.”

“Oh! I know those, those are 3D printing files, we use them at the library makerspace. You should be able to print those on any 3D printer” Jamie said, excited at first, but then her voice trailed off. 

“Right. I’ll just pull that out of my backpack.” Savannah said, sarcastically. 

“Hmm.” Jamie said, grumbling.

Savannah looked out once more at the lake and dam, took a deep breath, and said the only word that came to mind. 

“Damn”
 
### Chapter 4

Savannah’s phone rang as she bit into her hamburger. She’d just sat down at the weathered red picnic table next to a roadside dive that would have been her father’s go to spot. He loved drive-in burger spots, old man diners, and “greasy spoons” whatever that was. She figured she’d follow his lead on this trip.

She propped her phone up and answered the video call. “Whusup” she said through to Jamie through her mouthful of burger. 

“Okay, so I rounded up a few of the Scoobies” 

Jamie panned the phone around the room, and a motley and colorful crew of kids all waved and shouted “I can’t believe you found it!” And “Hi Sav!” to her.

Jamie came back on screen and continued. “We’ve been digging into the files that you sent. We were right about the 3D files, but there’s a bunch of other numbers in here titled BOM, and then some gerber files. I didn’t 
know what to make of that at first, but Alicia pulled up a site where you can get electronic components, digifree or something.”

“Digikey!” A voice, presumably Alicia’s, shouted from behind Jamie

“Digikey, right. It turns out these are part numbers on Digikey. It seems like this is everything you’re going to need to build this submarine drone thing.”

“Okay” Savannah said “but there’s still the small problem of me being here, and you all being across the country.”

Jamie smiled “I think I’ve got you covered there as well. I started looking for maker or hackerspaces near where you are, and it turns out you’re just a few miles from the Georgia Cyber Center’s innovation space, and get this, it’s on 1000 Grace Hopper way.”

“What’s a Grace Hopper?” Savannah asked, taking a bite of her fries

“Not what. Who! How do you not know who Grace Hopper was? Oh my gosh, she was one of the first computer scientists and basically invented the concept of programming languages, but she also wanted it use her skills to help the war effort in World War Two, and refused to take no for an answer, even though she was like a hundred pounds soaking wet. They finally let her in the navy, and she kicked so much butt she eventually became an Admiral. Then like 50 years later she would go on late night talk shows and explain to people why the internet was going to be a big deal. She was awesome. There’s even a whole conference named after her to get more women in tech.”

“Okay, she does sound kinda awesome” Savannah said 

“It also bodes well if this place is on a street named after her, I have a feeling this going to be our type of people. I’m sending you the location now. “

Savannah’s phone “ding”ed with the notification, and the pulled up the location on her map. 

“How is this 30 minutes from me. *Nothing* is 30 minutes from me out here” Savannah said, incredulous

“I know, right?” Jamie agreed “It’s like it’s meant to be. I jumped in their chat room and they said there’s an open hack night tonight and they’d be happy to have you. “

“What? That’s insane! Jamie, you’re the best!” Savannah said, switching back to the video call and smiling at her friend. 

Jamie made a show of breathing on her nails and polishing them on her shirt. “I know” she said, smugly.

“Hey, we helped!” Alicia said from the background as the other Scoobies joined in a chorus of “yeahs” and gently jostled Jamie. She laughed as the video feed shook.

“Okay, well, thank you everyone! Sounds like I’m off to make some new friends!” Savannah said as she packed up the remainder of her dinner, hung up the call, and headed for her car. 

### Chapter 5

“Alright, we’re going to start the tour so if this is your first time, come on over” Mateo shouted over the din of the crowd in the front room of the makerspace. He was tall and skinny, with a nerdy but charismatic vibe, and he’d clearly done this routine many times before. 

“IF this is your fist time at one of our open nights, welcome! If not, what the heck are you doing in my tour?” Mateo continued, to light laughter from the assembled newbies. Savannah chuckled politely, and nervously looked at the people around her. 

Most of the folks were a bit older than her, probably college age but with a few older folks mixed in at at least one lady that looked like she could be her grandma. 

“The makerspace at Georgia Cyber Center was opened in 2014 by students and faculty, and is open to the public mondays and Thursday evenings for our open nights” Mateo continued on. “You can also talk to one of our members about joining if you’re interested in coming in more often”

Savannah looked at the space around them. It was a big space with some big open tables that had folks sitting around working on various projects ,and the walls were lined with shelves with lots of what looked like half-dissected robots, work-in-progress creations, and scrap wood and materials. 

LED signs hung on the walls, but instead of displaying lettering like you might see in a shop window, the pulsed and glowed with color patterns and art. 

“So this brings us to our CNC mill” Mateo was still talking, and Savannah realized she’d fallen behind the group and was zoning out. She quickly ran to catch up. 

“Can we use the mill?” one of the newbies asked, and Mateo turned to answer him

“Not without a member’s help - some of our tools require training, and the Shopbot, CNC Mill, Lathe, and Laser cutter are all on that list, but we teach training classes regularly for members, and if you’re in a pinch and need something done faster you can put up a request on our forum, and someone can probably help you out for a fee. “

Savannah’s ears pricked up at that - she didn’t know what this was all going to cost to build, and she realized she might not be able to afford the help she was going to need. 

Mateo continued on, touring them through he 3D printing section, the woodshop, metalworking area, and even a glass blowing station. It was all pretty cool, but Savannah had a million questions about how to build her submarine drone, and it seemed really specific compared to things other folks were asking. 

“So that brings us back to the main room. As tonight’s one of our open nights, we encourage you to take out a project and work on it, and if you have something you need help with, just ask, most of the folks here love to help out and share knowledge! With that, we like to close up with our favorite ‘get to know you’ game ‘What are you Hacking On’ - so , take a seat, and then we’ll start, um, here on my right” Mateo said, indicating towards the guy who’d asked about the CNC mill. 

They all shuffled about a little, and most of the people in the tour took a seat at the main table. Savannah found an old rolling chair and pulled up to the table on the other side of Mateo so she’d be the last one called on, and pulled out her laptop, not sure what to say. 

Thankfully, it took a while for the focus to come around to her, as each person got asked what they were there to work on. 

Some were doing their first learning project with electronics, learning how to make and LED blink or a servo (whatever that was ) move.

Others were working on school projects to make interactive art and needed help with the coding, or just needed a space to work in a group together. 

Finally when Mateo called on Savannah, she could feel herself blushing. She’d never met these people, and she wasn’t exactly comfortable speaking in front of large groups, but what was she going to do. She needed help, and here was a group literally offering to help her. 

“Okay, Hi, who are you and what are you hacking on?” Mateo asked Savannah, smiling broadly. 

He seemed so genuine, and everyone around her seemed nice and wholesome in a nerdy way. The words starting coming out before Savanah really even knew what was happening. 

“Hi, um, my name’s Savannah and, um, I’m actually here all the way from Phoenix, and I don’t exactly know how to say this, but I’m kind of on this wild goose chase of a treasure hunt that my dad left me. So far, it brought me out to Lake Clarke, and then I actually found the next clue, and now I have to build a submarine and look for the final piece of the puzzle under the lake somewhere. “

There was a bit of a stunned silence, and Savannah was suddenly aware that she’d been talking really fast. She gave a nervous laugh, and continued “I know it sounds a bit crazy”

“No no wait” Mateo broke in “that doesn’t sound crazy, that sounds amazing!” The group around the table chimed in and with “yeahs” and a buzz of conversation.

“Wait, so is this like actual sunken treasure?” One of the other kids at the table asked. He was grinning, and and Savannah could see his big eyes looked genuinely excited under his mop of brown hair. 

“Well, no, the treasure itself is hidden on the blockchain, but there’s an NFC tag hidden under the lake I have to get close enough to read. “ 

“What do you mean you have to build a sub?” Another girl asked. She was a bit older than savannah.

“The clue I found includes plans for a submarine drone that you can build to find the the treasure. So far it’s got a bunch of 3D printable files, and a list of parts from someplace, but I’m still figuring it out.”

“Here” Mateo said, handing Savannah a cable “Can you put it up on the big screen?”

Savannah plugged the wire into her laptop and the screen mirrored up to the massive screen on the wall of the space. She flipped to the blueprints first.

“So this was the blueprint. I don’t really know how to read all of this, but some of it looks almost like IKEA instructions” Savannah said, and the group laughed a bit. Some folks stood up to get a closer look at the screen

“Look, it’s using screw drives for propulsion” Mateo said. The excitement was drawing over some of the regulars from the makerspace

“It looks like there’s two cameras up at the front, I wonder if that’s for stereo vision or VR first person piloting” another girl said, coming up to look. “That’d be so cool to ride around underwater in VR”

“What have we got here?” An older man with a beard said, walking over to the screen. He had a crew of kids in tow behind him

“Oh! Professor D! I think this is going to be right up your alley. Savannah, this is professor D, he runs the makerspace and taught most of us everything we know!”

“Hello Savannah, nice to meet you!” He said with an easy smile. “It’s been a while since I’ve seen everyone so excited at a craft night, what have you brought? This looks like plans for some kind of drone?”

“Yeah, it’s a submarine drone, I need it to find something under Clark’s hill lake. I’m kinda on a crazy treasure hunt”

“Whoa!” The kids behind Professor D said, joining the crowd around the TV.

“Wait, like real treasure?” One of the students asked Mateo.

Mateo turned to him and smiled. “Haha, yeah, I figured this would prick your ears up. Savannah, this is Liam. He’s been working on plans for a metal detector roomba to roam around the beach and find lost jewelry and stuff.”

Liam beamed up at Mateo “Yeah, I haven’t gotten around to building it yet, but I figured it might be a goldmine. I just need to figure out how to deal with all the sand getting in the gears and stuff. “

“Oh wow, that’s so cool” Savannah said. “My treasures a bit less… tangible though. It’s technically hidden on the blockchain, but I have to find and read an NFC tag that’s hidden under Clark’s HIll lake”

“What do you mean it’s hidden on the blockchain? Aren’t blockchain’s public?”

Savannah thought for a moment and realized she wasn’t entirely sure how it worked. “I guess I’m kind of looking for the key that unlocks it? My dad was more of the expert on it. He was a bit obsessed with this before he died. It’s called TreaasureDAO.”

“Oh! It’s a DAO!” Liam exclaimed. “Okay, that makes way more sense. So it’s like a little program that’s running, and you can interact with it”

“Yeah, exactly. It’s actually been running since before I was born, it’s just most folks have forgotten about it. My dad tried to solve one of the big puzzles and thought he had it, but he never had the time to go actually look where he thought things were hidden. When he passed, I kinda took up the torch, and I’ve got nothing but time this summer, so i figured I’d come give it a shot. I’ve actually gotten a lot further than I expected, but I’m way out of my depth here.”

“Pun intended?” Liam asked jokingly, motioning back to the plans for the sub. 

“Ugh” Mateo groaned at Liam’s joke. “Don’t get him started or you’ll be in for a million lake puns”

“Oh come on, I thought that one was pretty deep” Liam said, smiling mischievously.

“Ohmygod stop it!” Mateo said, wincing as if in pain 

“Listen, just because my jokes are out of your league”

Mateo looked at Liam for a moment quizzically, trying to figure out the latest pun. 

“League. Like 20,000 leagues under the sea?”

Mateo winced once more and covered his ears “Augh! No! I’m done!” And with that Mateo ran away laughing

Savannah watched the two boys teasing each other and smiled. As Mateo ran off, she gave Liam a side-eyed glance and said “You know what his problem is?”

“What” asked Liam.

“He just can’t fathom your humor”

“YES!” Liam yelled, putting both fists in the air in celebration, eyes wide with surprise and wearing a huge grin. Savannah burst out laughing at his sudden excitement. 

“Oh yes! This is great. Team pun for the win! Mateo’s going to hate this!” Liam continued.

Savannah laughed again, and felt herself relaxing. She was already making friends. This was going to be okay.

“So, what’s the next step here? How far have you gotten” Liam asked, looking back at the plans. 

“You’re looking at it.  I just solved the 2nd piece of the puzzle this morning, found these plans, and my friend Jamie helped me find all of you. Other than that I don’t even really know how to start.”

“Hmm.” Professor D said, still standing nearby with his gaggle of students. “Well, it just so happens that our summer cohort here is looking for a project to work on. I think this could be a lot of fun, but I don’t want to horn in if this is your thing”

Savannah looked up at the smiling professor and his students. “Oh no, that would be awesome! I need help with this, there’s no way I’m going to figure this out on my own”

“Well, I wouldn’t be so quick to say that. I have a feeling that you’d be able to tackle this, but if you don’t mind the company, it’d be a great learning experience for all of us. Of course, whatever you find, at the end, that’s still yours. We’d just like to come along for the ride, right?” Professor D said, half-asking, half-telling the students behind him. 

The students answered behind him with a chorus of “yeah” and “oh totally”

Savannah looked at Liam and he smiled at her. 

“Well, what do you think? Can we all join you on this little quest?”

She thought for a moment, and remembered the password she needed to enter to unlock the plans. She had a feeling that even if someone beat her to the final clue under the lake, they’d still need the first 2 pieces of the puzzle. There was something telling her she could trust these people. She already felt at home. 

She smiled up at them. “Okay.”

“Whoo! Time to hunt some treasure!” Liam yelled, and they all laughed. 

“Okay, first thing first, we need to break this problem down into it’s simplest tasks” Professor D began, and the students began to sit around the table. Savannah joined them.

CHAPTER 6
“Savannah, can you grab that?” Mia said, gesturing to a long white strip of fabric that was sliding off the long table at the makerspace. 

“What? Oh shoot” Savannah exclaimed, looking up from her work to see Mia’s project sliding down onto the floor. She leaned over and caught it, returning it to the table while Mia grabbed the other end. 

“Thanks!” Mia said, smiling at Savannah. “The fans keep blowing it around!” she said, gesturing up at the fans oscillating over the huge space. They barely cut through the muggy midsummer Georgia air. 

“No problem!” Savannah said, returning Mia’s smile. “Tell me about your project again?”

“I call it the ‘breathing room’ - it’s an interactive art piece made with inflatable nylon fabric. The idea is that you go into the room and the room syncs up to your heartbeat and breathing. The lights pulse and change with your heart, and nylon inflates and deflates dozens of thin tubes around you, kind of like a giant sea anemone.”

“That’s so cool!” Savannah said. “So you’re turning fans on and off to inflate the tubes?”

“I started with that, but it wasn’t quite fast enough, so now I’ve got it hooked up to an air compressor back in the main tool room, and using relays to open the nozzles into each tube. Here watch” Mia said as she opened the nozzle attached to the long white nylon tube on the table. It immediately sprang to life, inflating like one of those waving arm displays in front of a used car shop. “And then when I turn the LEDs on” Mia continued, and now the tentacle-like tube was waving gently on the table while a rainbow of colors glowed up and down it’s length. 

“Oh my gosh, that’s so awesome” Savannah said. She pressed against the fabric and it gave easily, and she could feel the air moving under her fingers. “That’s gotta look amazing in the dark”

“It really does, I’m super happy with it. Now I just need to make another 63 of them” Mia said with a wry smile. “By Tuesday”

“Oh wow” Savannah said, her eyes wide. 

“Yeah, but I did it to myself, I kept tweaking the design until the last minute, and now I’ve got less than a week until my installation goes live. Looks like I’ll be sleeping here at the space for a few nights! Oh, speaking of, did you get hooked up with a place to stay?”

“Oh yeah! Professor D had a chat with the dean, and they’re allowing me to use one of the dorms while I’m in town, since they’re basically empty for the summer. They technically got me into the work study program to get me free housing, which is amazing, I’ve just gotta do some of the cleanup work around the woodshop and stuff”

“That’s amazing. Professor D is the best. How’s your sub coming along” Mia asked

“Well, we’re starting to make some progress” Savannah began, sounding a little less excited now. “I guess I didn’t realize how big an endeavor it was. I got here and found the second clue, and then I found all of you so fast, it really seemed like it was all just going to fall into place. “

“Yeah, all of my projects go like that. It sounds so easy on paper, and then here I am pulling all nighters” Mia laughed. “But I saw you’re 3D printing parts already, so it looks like you’re making headway!” Mia said encouragingly. 

“We’ve got the main body done, and we’re starting to work on the screw drive propellers. It seems like the files were tweaked for an older 3D printer, so we might have to make some final adjustments to them, but that part I think we’ll figure out. The real problem right now is getting parts.” Savannah said

“Really, with all the crap Professor D has in the share bins?”

Savanah laughed. “yeah, we’ve been through the share bins, the junk drawer, and even professor D’s secret stash, and we found a bunch of stuff,  but there was a specific chip that was like an arduino spinoff with bluetooth that they based this on that’s just not around anymore, and it sounds like I’m going to have to rework the old code.”

“So what you’re saying is it’s ‘hard to port’”? Liam said, ducking in from the back room and clearly proud of his pun. Savannah rolled her eyes and smiled.  

“Get it?” Liam continued “Like, ‘hard to starboard’, ‘hard to port’. And like porting code”

“Yes, explain the joke Liam, that makes it funnier” Mia said, laughing at him. Liam just grinned anyway. 

“So, where are we at?” He said, sitting down next to savannah. She pulled up the project plan on her laptop and looked at the long list of tasks they needed to complete. 

“Well, we’ve got about half the parts printed, and I was able to source motors for the drives and servos for the ballast.” Savannah said

“Nice! The gears are really turning now!” Liam said, smiling

“You really never stop do you?” Savannah said, smiling in spite of herself

“Oh there’s no off switch. Believe me, my parents tried everything” Liam said, eliciting a slightly-too-loud laugh from Mia. 

Liam shot her a side eye and quipped “making sure my ego doesnt’ get… over-inflated?” he said, poking Mia’s inflatable fabric tentacle on the table. 

“Ohhhmygod” Mia groaned

“Yes! First groan of the night. Now I’m all pumped up.” Liam continued rapid fire, and then just as quickly turned to face Savannah’s laptop and dropped into serious project mode. “Okay, so we’ve got the motors, the servos, we still need cameras, the main board, and a way to communicate back to the surface. What are you doing for battery?”

Savannah blinked a few times at Liam’s lightning fast change of pace, but knew that if she could catch him while he was excited, he could help her plow through problems like nobody else at the space. “Well” she started “We’ve got some lithium cells for the battery, but we’re going to need to do some tests to see how long we can run the propeller with it

“The bigger problem” savannah continued, “is that we just can’t find this old arduino derivative chip, and most off the shelf stuff does WiFi or bluetooth, which doesn’t seem like a great solution since they don’t broadcast through water well. Professor D thinks we should start with some modern single board computer and go from there”

“Like the Adapute board?” Liam said, digging a small circuit board from his bag, with a few devices hanging off it, connected by colorful wires.

“Wait, did you already get one?” Savannah said, excitedly

“Nah, I’ve got like 3 in my locker. If we’re using this, then the battery is really simple, we can plug any lithium ion battery in and it will regulate it down to 3.3 volts and charge it when it’s plugged in. If we go with something beefy like an RC car battery, we can use that to drive the motors and servo too”

“Oh yeah, that’s basically what I’m doing too” Mia said from the other end of the table. “I’ve got a Pi running my computer vision code, and then it uses a relay controller board to open and close the nozzles from the air compressor. Those have to be wired directly to the power source, it’s too much power for the computer board.”

“Yup, it’s the same idea” Liam said. 

“Can I ask a question though?” Mia said “I mean, I’m obviously an inflatables nerd now because of my art installation, but I don’t really understand how the submarine works. Once you go down, there’s no air to inflate with. How do you make the sub rise again?”

“Oh yeah! that’s the neat part about ballasts. You don’t have to fill them with anything, because you can fill them with nothing.”

Mia looked confused for a moment, and then her eyebrows went up and she put it together. “Oh, so it’s a vacuum?” 

“Well, it doesn’t suck!” Liam quipped, and Mia shot him a look while he grinned at her stupidly. “But yes, here, I’ll show you” he continued 

Liam picked up a comically large syringe from the table, like a big doctors needle but without the pointy metal bit at the end and placed the nozzle against his palm. “it’s like this syringe. As I pull the plunger up, it creates a vacuum and sticks to my hand. 

He demonstrated pulling the plunger out, and then tried to pull the syringe from his hand. The nozzle held tight and pulled his skin away from his hand as if it were glued there. 

“So I don’t have to fill it with air, I can just push the water out and leave a vacuum in the ballast canister. That changes the buoyancy of the sub, and you can go up or down to any depth you want!” 

Liam let the plunger go and it snapped back into the syringe with a “pop” and then fell to the table. “Ow, hand hickey” Liam said, rubbing the little red dot on his palm where the syringe had been. 

“Haha, got it!” Mia said. “Thanks!”

Savannah looked at the parts Liam had in front of him. “So does that mean we have what we need to start putting it together?” She asked

“Enough to get started at least, here, let’s start by hooking up the Adapute to the rudders.

Liam took the body of the 3d printed sub from in front of Savannah and pried it’s 2 halves apart revealing the wires and motors inside. He plugged the connectors on the little circuit board he was holding into the connectors from the rudders, and then plugged the board into the battery. As he plugged the board in, the motors gave a little twitch, and the rudders on the back fins of the sub’s fins wiggled. 

“Oooh!” Savanah exclaimed, excited to see the sub actually starting to spring to life. 

“Eets Aliiiive!” Liam said in a mad scientist voice, and Savannah laughed. Liam pulled his laptop out and opened a program

“Okay, now we just need to connect to our board” he said as he opened a menu and selected Adapute-Liam-003 from a list of devices nearby. “And there we go!” Liam said as he slid his computer over to Savannah

“Uhh, wha?” Savannah said, giving Liam a bit of side-eye. “I have, um, less than zero idea of what to do with this”

Liam just smiled “Professor D’s law of the lab: learn by doing. You’ve got this, it’s just a REPL, have you ever programmed before?”

“A little back in High School, but it wasn’t exactly my forte”

“haha yeah, programming classes are usually a little dry. It’s way more fun when you’re connected to the real world. I’ll talk you through. This is just a little Python console that will immediately execute any commands you enter, and the Adapute board already has libraries that take care of all the hard stuff. Here, type this: Import “Servo” then hit enter 

Savannah type out the command, but nothing seemed to happen

“That imported the servo control library, which will let us move the rudders. Now let’s make a variable that points to one of them. The left/right rudder is on pin...” he looked over at the board’s wires inside the sub “seven. Okay so we can define a variable that points to that by typing `rudder_horizontal = servo.Servo (7)`

Savannah typed, with Liam watching. He noticed a small mistake and said “Right, but with the parenthesis right next to the second Servo, that’s a function of the servo library, and we’re passing it 7 as a variable to tell it what pin to talk on

“Got it” Savannah said, and hit enter. Still, nothing happened with the sub

“One more step!” Liam said “Now type `rudder_horizontal.angle = 45` “

Savannah typed the command, and immediately the rudders made a little “zwwip!” Noise and the sub shifted on the table

“Oh!” Savannah exclaimed! “There it goes” 

“haha, yup!” Liam said, smiling at her excitement. “That’s all there is to it! Pretty simple right?”

“I think so, let me try something” Savannah said, and she typed `rudder_horizontal.angle = 135` and hit enter

The rudder quickly swung to around in the other direction. 

“Ah! Okay, I’ve got this! So what pin is the vertical rudder on?”

“Pin 8. can you figure it out from here?”

Savannah looked at the screen in concentration, studying what they’re entered so far. 

“So we’ve already got the library, I don’t need to import it again, right? I think I just need to assign another new servo to a new variable.” 

She typed away, at the keyboard 

`rudder_vertical = servo.Servo(8)`
`rudder_vertical.angle = 45`

The second rudder on the fins of the sub sprung to life, holding itself at a forty-five degree angle as well. 

“Nice!” Liam said “You’ve got it! So you can always open up the REPL and test out commands like this, but if you want the sub to do stuff on it’s own, we’ll need to save that to a file. For today, let’s get the rudders going and get some basic motor controls going. Eventually we’ll want to get a little fancier and give the sub some ability to drive itself and hold course and position, but for now we just need to be able to drive the thing to test it out.”

“Alright, I think I’ve got this!” Savannah said, and hunkered down to work.

CHAPTER 7
“Hey, she does exist!” Jamie said through the tinny speaker of Savannah’s phone

“Jamie, it’s been like 3 days” Savannah quipped back, smiling. 

“Do you know the last time we went three days without talking?” Said Jamie

“Eighth grade. The Tobey incident” Savannah said , rolling her eyes. 

“Exactly! A major friendship crisis. So unless you’ve met someone Tobey-level cute, I expect an explanation. I thought maybe they’d abducted you!” Jamie said, only half-joking. 

“Okay okay, so I’ve been a bad friend! I’ve just been really absorbed, we’re getting so close to being able to finish the sub, and there’s like a whole crew helping out now. Professor D has his class tasked with how we’re going to communicate with the sub underwater, and we’ve been using the pool late nights after the swim team is out of there to test our devices, and then after that Liam is still helping me program the device”

“Oooh, who’s Liam” Jamie said, now interested. 

“Oh, it’s not like that, Liam is like totally in love with Mateo. He’s just a good friend”

“Mmm hmm” Jamie said knowingly. 

Savannah laughed. “I mean it. It’s totally platonic. Anyway, he’s been amazing, and we’re making real progress. I’m excited to get the sub in the water. I can’t believe it’s been 3 weeks already. “

“Yeah, I was starting to wonder if you were going to be a Georgia girl now.”

“Well, I’d be lying if I said i wasn’t considering it. These kids are so smart and passionate about what they’re learning and making, and Professor D is great. They’re already on me to transfer here.”

“What? That’s so cool” 

“Yeah, I just want to stay focused though. Once we solve the puzzle, then I can figure out what’s next.”

“Two more puzzles after that, right?”

“right, they’re all in random batches of three so you can’t cheat by knowing the solutions in advance. There’s a minor reward on each puzzle, but I don’t get the big payout unless I solve all 3, and summer’s starting to feel really short.”

“If all the puzzles are like this, yeah, it’s going to be a race against the clock”

“Oh god I hope not, I don’t think I can do another 2 like this, but for now all I can do is keep working on this”

“Eyes on the prize, treasure hunter. You’ve got this.”

“Enough about me though, what’s been going on with you?” Savannah said, realizing she’d been so caught up in her treasure hunting that she hadn’t been paying any attention to her friend, even before the last few days. 

Jamie smiled a little in a sad way, as if saying “it’s okay, you don’t have to pretend to care”, but the look flickered across her face only for a moment, and she quickly covered it saying “Eh, you know how it is. Daily life, library drama”

“Wait there’s drama and you didm’t tell me?” Savannah exclaimed, “Dish!”

Jamie rolled her eyes and laughed “Okay okay. Well, you know the new research assistant? They want to digitize a bunch of the old town documents. 

“Ugh, again?” Savannah said. Clearly they’d been down this road before

“Right?” Jamie answered “like it hasn’t all be loaded into some database or other 5 times already. It’s like these grad students think they invented the scanner, and refuse to look at what the last year’s batch did. I swear some of the PDFs we’ve got are older than me. Oh, and you’ll never guess what Ms. Nunez got!”

“Another cat?” Jamie and Savannah both said in unison, devolving into a giggle fit. 

They continued chatting for hours, and Savannah could feel the distance between them mending a bit, but she also knew something was different. She found her mind wandering to her project, and her new life here, however temporary. 

Later, as she sat out on the balcony of her loaned dorm room, Savannah looked out at the stars and felt like she was a long way from home now. It wasn’t a homesick feeling, like Dorothy and Toto in Oz, more like a realization home was a thing that had happened to another person in another time.  Her dad’s funeral, graduation, her job. It all just felt a... small. 

She felt very alone, there in the dark and mostly empty dorms, but it wasn’t exactly a bad feeling. She was getting used to being by herself. After all, she’d never really been on her own before, she’d always been taking care of her dad. Now it was just her. 

Her and her quest. 

## CHAPTER 8

“Ready?” Professor D shouted, his voice echoing off the glass walls surrounding the campus swimming pool. Savannah, Liam, and Mateo, were standing at the other end of the pool, gathered around Savannah’s laptop. 

“Ready!” Savannah hollered back. Along the edge of the pool, a chorus of enthusiastic cheering rose up from the handful of Professor D’s class who were here for the sub’s final pool test. Many of them had had a hand in the build now, working on the communication system from the sub to the water, mapping algorithms, or attempting to boost the read-range of the RFID tag underwater. 

NOTE: their comms device can be a peizoelectric backscatter array modeled on this work:
[Device offers long-distance, low-power underwater communication](https://news.mit.edu/2023/devices-offers-battery-free-underwater-communication-0906)

“And, go!” Professor D said, as he tossed 3 RFID beacons into the pool at random spots. 

The little sub sprung to life under the water, turning slightly as it oriented itself against the positioning buoy above it, and sinking down into the pool until it hovered just above the bottom.  Finally, it turned 90 degrees left and started motoring towards the pool wall. Another chorus of cheers rose up. The little drone had started it’s search. 

The sub methodically proceeded to the edge of the pool and detected the side before colliding with it, and then turned to follow the side. It continued until it had gone a ways up the wall, and then turned in towards the center of the pool, beginning it’s zigzag pattern across the bottom of the pool. 

Savannah, Mateo, and Liam watched a low-resolution video feed from the front of the sub, as it transmitted what it was seeing through the water. Mateo grabbed Liam’s shoulders from behind and shook him excitedly. It was working!

The sub continued back and forth, coming close to the beacon, as the assembled crowd made an excited “ohhhh!” Sound together, and then an “aww” as it turned and went back the other way without quite catching it. 

Finally, on it’s next pass, the crowd swelled with excitement again, and as it passed over the RFID tag, Savannah’s laptop made a loud “boon” sound, indicating it had gotten a ping back from an RFID tag. The data came up, and she shouted

“We got one!”

The team was all raucous applause now, happy to see their shared work come to fruition. The sub continued it’s way around the pool, and eventually found the other two beacons, followed by more cheering. 

“Well, happy?” Professor D said to Savannah as she accepted the last of the high fives and hugs from his crew of summer kids. 

“Very” Said Savannah. “Thank you so much for your help. All of you” 

“Thank you for letting us be part of your project!” Professor D continued ” That was some of the most fun I think we’ve all had working on something in a long time. So are you ready to get this on a boat?”

“I don’t think there’s much else more we can do. I‘ve gotta get out there and start looking” Savannah said

“Well,” Professor D said “I’ve told Mateo I want daily reports”

“Wait, what?” Savannah said, looking up at Mateo and Liam, who’d been her closest partners these last few weeks. She’d thought she’d be going out on her own to deploy the sub, and she was already working on chartering a small rental boat to take her out on her first few days of searching. 

“Professor D’s give us a few days off from the lab to come out with you on your search” Liam said, smiling.

Savannah felt a prickly heat behind her eyes, and blinked it away before it turned into real tears. She couldn’t quite believe, even after everything that they’d done for her, that these people could be even nicer. 

“Oh my gosh, guys, really?”

“We wouldn’t miss it!” Mateo said. 

## CHAPTER 9
“Soon may the weatherman come, to bring us sugar and tea and rum” Liam sang, and Mateo joined in harmony “One day when the toung’in is done we’ll take our leave and go” 

By the third chorus, most of the kids on the boat were singing along, doing their best to fill in the harmony of the sea shanty that they’d all heard a dozen times on viral clips. 

The spirit on the boat was jubilant. they were all off in search of Savannah’s treasure, getting ready to test all the systems that they’d built to make her sub work, and now they were on a boat on the lake on a beautiful summer day. The rains had cooled things off finally, and there was even a nice breeze as the boat motored over the light chop. Professor D manned the helm. 

“Savannah” he called, waving her over to the captains chair with it’s oversized steering wheel. “Here, take over” he said, motioning to the controls. 

“I don’t know how...” She started, but he just smiled and waved her in. 

“It’s easier than driving, and besides, what are you going to hit out here? Just stay to the right of the buoys, and if you get nervous, you just take the throttle down there.” He said, pointing to the black lever on her right. 

He walked up to take in the beautiful surroundings from the front of the boat she’d chartered, and Savannah quickly got the hang of piloting the ship. She felt the delay between turning and when the boat finally swung around in that direction, and fishtailed along a bit while she got the hang of not over-correcting. 

She checked the GPS on her phone, and saw that they were getting close to the coordinates that they’d uncovered in her clue. They had a center point, and then 100 meter radius that they’d be looking in, and that was if the device was still working and hadn’t been disturbed or moved in the past 17 years.

Eventually, Savannah backed off the throttle, and she slowly closed in on the little dot on her map. Finally, she cut the engine, and Professor looked back at her from the prow of the boat. “Is this the spot?” He called

“Near as I can get” she said “we’ll have to search all around here anyway, might as well start at the center.

“Makes sense to me! Hey, Mateo, know how to weigh and anchor?” He called, and went off to work with the older boy as they got the anchor tossed over. It seemed to go down quite a ways. 

Meanwhile, Savannah and the rest of the crew started to get the drone unpacked. They set the pelican case on the center of the boat deck, and opened it up to unearth the drone from the carefully packed foam inserts they made. Piece by piece they got it assembled on the deck until it looked a bit like an oblong satellite, with little antenna sticking up off it’s back, cameras like eyes at the front, and it’s spiral motors and rudder at the tail. 

“It’s so cool how this all came together!” Mia said to Savannah as they were connecting the wire harnesses between the watertight computer and battery and the motors and sensors. “A few weeks ago, this was just some crazy plan that you’d brought in.”

“Right?” Savannah said “it’s crazy. You’ve all done so much, I never would have gotten this all together on my own. And it feels like I’ve known you all so much longer than a week. 

“I know, I remember that from my freshman year, that first time you’re away from home, that first month or two feels like a lifetime, and some of the connections you make last forever. Did you know that Mateo and I were in the same freshman cohort?”

“Oh no way! So you were in classes together and stuff?”

“Oh yeah, the school tries to make sure that kids aren’t isolated when they first arrive, so they group you up with a bunch of likeminded folks. We were in the same dorms, same 101 classes, all of that, and then of course we’re both lgbtq and nerds, so we found Professor D and the maker space pretty quickly. We uh, even dated for a little while.”

“Wait what?” Savannah said, nearly dropping the screwdriver she was assembling the drone’s camera with. “But I thought you were both...”

“Well, labels can be over-rated” Mia said, smiling. “I mean, I’m bi, but Mateo was still figuring things out. It’s so funny looking back on it, it all felt so serious, but we were just babies really.”

“You were older than I am now” Savannah said, resuming her work, and trying not to take offense 

“That’s the thing though, you seem so much older though. I bet you hear this all the time but you’ve got like an...”

“An ‘old soul’” yeah. I get it all the time. Ah the lasting effects of having to parent your parents. I mean, my dad tried his best but he went through a lot and then when his health started to fail... I didn’t get a ton of time to be a kid. I think that’s part of why I’m doing all this. I need to do something stupid and fun and adventurous before I got caught up in a job and school.”

“Well, there’s plenty of time to do stupid stuff at school, let me tell you” Mia said, laughing. “But seriously, when you get to your college in a few weeks, you’ll see. Most of these kids, they’ve never had a lick of responsibility or real freedom in their lives, and it’s like they try to use it up all at once. Freshman year is a hot mess. You’re nothing like most of those kids. I still say you should defer to spring semester and just come here with us. You know Prof D is ready to go right to the dean for you”

Savannah smiled “I know. and believe me I’m thinking about it, but there’s a lot left for me to piece together. In the meantime, I’m just focused on finding this treasure, and then finding out what the next piece of the puzzle is.”

“All right” Mia said, smiling at Savannah once more “but I’m gonna keep trying. We’ll wear you down eventually. Okay, are we ready to drop this thing in?” 

“Savannah finished putting the final rubber gasket over the screw she was just tightening, and stood up to look at their handiwork. The drone was as ready as they were ever going to get it. She reached under and pressed the power button, and the device popped to life, its rudders twitching and then snapping into place, straight back.”

“Don’t forget your leash little guy” Mateo said, clipping the thin safety cable to the drone. If anything happened they wanted to be able to haul it up. 

“Wave hi!” Professor D said to the assembled crew as Savannah and Mia lifted the drone and pointed its dual cameras at them. They all smiled and waved as the image appeared on the professors laptop monitor. He panned around on the image, and was satisfied that things looked good. “The stereoscopic input looks good, we should get decent 3D data as well while it’s down there”

“Okay, time to do this?” Savannah asked, smiling at Mia. She was excited, everything they’d been working towards for almost the last month was finally getting a real test. 

“Here we go!” Said Mia, and together they gently lifted the drone over the side of the boat. They each held onto the side of the boat with one hand while lowering the drone down with the other, and finally let go with a little splash as it submerged the rest of the way. It floated just below the surface. 

“Everything’s still online.” Liam said, looking at the readouts on another laptop. “Starting the descent routine”

He pressed a key, and the drone’s little motors started to whine, pulling water into the ballasts and the drone began to sink beneath the surface. In a moment, all they could see was the safety cable slowly being pulled down into the water as it unraveled on deck. 

On the monitor, they couldn’t see much either. The wavy rays of sun coming through the waves on the surface soon darkened, and then the drone just seemed to descend through endless gray water with little bright specs floating gently upward in their view as they passed the light. 

“10 meters” Mateo called out as the drone descended. 

“20”

“25” 

Suddenly, the drones camera view shook and became blindingly bright, and the safety cable abruptly stopped unspooling off the deck. 

“Oops” Mateo said. “I guess the bottom detection didn’t work very well. Looks like we kicked up a lot of silt.”

“It should be fine” Liam said, reassuring Savannah as much as himself “All the delicate stuff is on top. How’s the data feed?”

“Looks like it’s okay, still plenty of bandwidth to pick up the video feed and control it”

Savannah watched as the silt settled and the bright white faded back to gray and then eventually the horizon of the bottom cleared in front of them. 

There really was a town down here. Submerged under the lake were half buried and waterlogged ghosts of old buildings, and it looked like they’d landed right next to one

“Well there’s your problem” the professor said, indicating the outline of bricks taking up the side of their view. “Looks like we smacked into the top of this old chimney on the way down.”

Savannah looked at the camera’s view and still had trouble making it all out. “Liam, it looks like there’s something on the lenses. Can we try to shake it off a bit?” 

“Oui, mon capitan” Liam said in his best French sailor accent. “Commenceir operacion ‘petit rave’” he continued, and then proceeded to move the two control joysticks in a rhythmic beat while making a rave-music “oontz oontz oontz” sound. He increased to double time, beatboxing as he wiggled the joysticks, and then released them with a flourish. “Et voila” He said with a smile, gesturing towards the monitor. 

“You are the weirdest” Mia said, rolling her eyes at him

“Merci mon Cher” Liam just beamed back, and then raised his eyebrow, indicating towards the screen. 

Just then the dust that Liam had kicked up with his little drone dance routine settled, and sure enough the lenses were now perfectly clear, and they had an HD view of the lake bottom. 

“Okay, should we start our search?” Mia asked

“What about those buildings? In the pool we really didn’t have obstacles to deal with.” Savannah said. 

“True, but the drone’s search pattern should at least attempt to avoid things. Let’s see how we do.” Professor D said. 

“Okay, Liam, start it up” Savannah said. 

“Here we go!” Liam said, and hit the button. 

In a moment, the drone sprung to life, lifting slightly off the lake floor. Its motions were slow and methodical, designed to avoid stirring up too much silt, and it make a slow path forward before swinging back and passing over the area just next to where it started. After 10 meters, it doubled back again, continuing its zig-zag pattern.

“Check out the pattern in the sand” Mateo said, looking at the screens. “It’s like a freshly mowed lawn” The group laughed and agreed, their little drone really was leaving a pattern of neat rows in the dirt and sand at the bottom of the lake. 

The crew watched for a while as the drone made its passes across the open space next to the chimney, and then it made a series of beeps. they gathered next to the professor’s laptop. 

“What’s up?” Mateo asked

“Looks like there’s something sticking up here. The drone’s trying to work around it. Liam how’re we doing”

“It can’t find an edge to go around, so it looks like it’s going up over it, it’s trying to ascend”

“Trying?” Savannah asked, with a note of worry in her voice. 

“Yeah. The ballast tanks are like half empty, but it’s depth meter’s not really changing and look, we’re kinda pointing down at the ground now.”

Indeed, the view from the cameras had titled sideways and downward, as if the drone was starting to drift up by its tail.

“That’s not how that’s supposed to work” Mateo said. “Are we caught on something?”

“I didnt’ see anything, and none of the collision switches are firing, but yeah. It should be bobbing right up now, and it’s just not moving. 

“Okay, should we start our search?” Mia asked

“What about those buildings? In the pool we really didn’t have obstacles to deal with.” Savannah said. 

“True, but the drone’s search pattern should at least attempt to avoid things. Let’s see how we do.” Professor D said. 

“Okay, Liam, start it up” Savannah said. 

“Here we go!” Liam said, and hit the button. 

In a moment, the drone sprung to life, lifting slightly off the lake floor. Its motions were slow and methodical, designed to avoid stirring up too much silt, and it make a slow path forward before swinging back and passing over the area just next to where it started. After 10 meters, it doubled back again, continuing its zig-zag pattern.

“Check out the pattern in the sand” Mateo said, looking at the screens. “It’s like a freshly mowed lawn” The group laughed and agreed, their little drone really was leaving a pattern of neat rows in the dirt and sand at the bottom of the lake. 

The crew watched for a while as the drone made its passes across the open space next to the chimney, and then it made a series of beeps. they gathered next to the professor’s laptop. 

“What’s up?” Mateo asked

“Looks like there’s something sticking up here. The drone’s trying to work around it. Liam how’re we doing”

“It can’t find an edge to go around, so it looks like it’s going up over it, it’s trying to ascend”

“Trying?” Savannah asked, with a note of worry in her voice. 

“Yeah. The ballast tanks are like half empty, but it’s depth meter’s not really changing and look, we’re kinda pointing down at the ground now.”

Indeed, the view from the cameras had titled sideways and downward, as if the drone was starting to drift up by its tail.

“That’s not how that’s supposed to work” Mateo said. “Are we caught on something?”

“I didnt’ see anything, and none of the collision switches are firing, but yeah. It should be bobbing right up now, and it’s just not moving. 

“Okay, this is great!” Professor D said, smiling. the rest of the crew looked at him with expressions that said “obviously this is not great”.

“No, I mean it, this is production hardware 101. No matter what you plan for, something’s going to be different out in the field. Software, hardware, it doesn’t matter. So now we have to hotfix in the field, this is a great exercise. Now, we need ideas. What’s different between this and our pool test”

“Depth” Mia said first. “The pool’s only a few meters deep. Maybe the depth and pressure is too different and the ballast failed.

“Good!” The professor said, writing it down on his laptop. “What else”

“All the muck down there” Savannah said. “The pool water was completely clean. Maybe something’s gumming up the works”

“Yes. What else?” The professor said

“The distance. Maybe the commands aren’t getting to the drone” Liam said 

“Yeah, but we’re getting visuals and data” Mateo chimed in, but the professor stopped him. 

“Hang on, we’ll take each of these in turn in a moment. Stay in idea generation mode. What else”

“Maybe we’re tangled in a weed” Mia offered

“Or a fish is hanging on?” Liam echoed, smiling slightly

“What about plastic trash or fishing line” Mateo said 

Savannah’s eye lit up. Thinking about the fishing line sparked a realization for her, and she tapped Liam’s arm with her palm. 

“Wait, wait wait… the safety cable” She said, and they all locked eyes for a moment, the obvious answer now right in front of them. 

Liam ran over to the side and began pulling gently on the safety cable. It came up freely and then Mateo started yelling. “Whoa whoa whoa stop!” 

“What?” Liam said, looking over at the monitors. The screen was a jumble of debris and bubbles floating both up and down in front of the camera. 

“It’s coming up” Mateo said looking at the readout. “fast. Its ballasts are basically empty. I’m stopping the routine” Mateo said, pressing some keys on the keyboard, and the watched as the drone continue to drift up sideways through the inky water, and then finally through the rays of sun shining through the surface. 

The drone surfaced with a quiet whoosh and then a splash as it righted itself, having come up like a cork bobbing on the water.

“Well, that was unexpected!” the professor said. “So, what happened. Savannah, theories?”

“The safety cable was weighing it down. Once it had pulled so much of it down, the ballast wasn’t enough to lift it all back up”

“Sure seems like it” the professor said “Now that I think about it, it’s an interesting challenge. What do you think we could do about it”

“Can we put the safety cable on some tension, so it automatically reels back in?” Mia asked. 

“The drone’s just not that heavy. It was already slow going down pulling the cable in. And if we add weight to it, the ballasts aren’t big enough to bring it back up.”

“We’re also a center point, so if the cable is tight, it won’t be able to maintain depth as it moves away from us” Liam said, making a pendulum motion with his finger. 

“We could reel the cable back in whenever it’s trying to ascend” Savannah said

“Yeah, but it should go up and down a lot to go over obstacles, and you’ll constantly be reeling and letting it loose. And we’ll still have a similar issue if it swims back towards us, the cable will build up. 

“What about dropping the safety cable? It worked fine in the pool” Mia said. 

They all looked to Savannah, it was her drone, and her call. She didn’t say anything for a while, and then the professor piped up. 

“I’m going to speak for Savannah and say that I don’t think that’s the right move for today. this was just our first issue, and there’s bound to be more. We don’t want this little drone’s first mission to be it’s last. Let’s work this through, there’s got to be another way.”

“So the problem is that the safety cable needs to adjust for the drone’s distance and depth” Liam said

“Right.” The professor nodded

“What if the reel was robotic as well?” Savannah said with her head cocked at an angle. 

The professor smiled. “There you go. Think it through, what would that mean”?

“We could reel the cable in and out depending on how far down the drone wants to be, and how far away from the boat it is” Savannah said, puzzling it through 

“I think that might work” Liam said, “it doesn’t even need to be perfect, we can give it a little slack, but it just can’t have so much that the cable pulls it down. 

“And we know where the drone is at any moment. We can spin the reel in and out with a little servo as the drone goes back and forth along the bottom.”

“It sounds like you’ve got a good idea, and we can test it back at the pool to make sure it’s working well before we get back on the boat” Professor D said, cheerfully. 

Savannah suddenly felt a wave of emotion come over her. Everything had been leading up to this moment, and she’d imagined that it might take a while but she couldn’t help but hope that they’d get lucky and find it right away. Instead, they hadn’t even really started searching today. 

There had been so many challenges, so many little tasks and puzzles that they’d already helped her through, and she felt like she’d let them all down. She wanted to be strong and positive and talk about how they’d fix it, but the more she tried, the hotter her cheeks felt, and the more her eyes hurt. She felt the lump rising in her throat, and looked away from the professor and the rest of the students

“Umm, looks like we’ve got another problem” Mateo said, as he hauled it in the drone by its cable. The little array of antennas on the back of the drone was half missing. “Looks like maybe the cable dragged across the top and taken a few of our antennas with it. We’ll need to rebuild the array and…”

Savannah couldn’t hold it in any longer. The pain and frustration welled up and as she began to cry, the embarrassment of losing it in front of her new friends just compounded and made it all worse.

They froze for a moment as Savannah began to bawl in earnest, not sure what to do. Mia quickly slid next to her and hugged her, and Professor D walked over and put his hand on her shoulder 

“Hey kiddo. It’s okay, this is how it goes. No hardware works on the first try. We’re going to work this out.” he said.

Savannah wanted to say “but it’s all a disaster, and you all came out with me here and nothing worked and we need to start over” but all she managed to do was shake her head and try to stifle her quiet sobs. She felt Mia rub her back and she leaned into her.

After a bit, Mia started to talk quietly. “Just so you know, this is pretty much a rite of passage for each of us. 3 nights ago I was in tears over my installation, and almost smashed the power supply with a mallet.”

Savannah laughed quietly between her silent sob/hiccups in spite of herself, imagining Mia with an oversized rubber mallet going to town on her project. She looked up and Mia was smiling sweetly at her.

“And that’s just an art project” Mia continued. “You’ve got so much wrapped up in this, with your dad and all. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed.”

Savannah look around at the crew she’d assembled, all out on this adventure, working with her, and at the beautiful scene of the lake and trees. She felt herself calming down, and managed to nod and smile back a bit at Mia. 

“Here’s what I say” Mia continued. “You’ve been working too hard. This will all be there waiting for us when we get back to the space Monday, but you’re burnt out. It’s time to shake things up. Tomorrow’s my art opening and what you might not know is that us nerds can throw a hell of a party. You’re coming as my guest, and I I’m not taking no for an answer.”

“I think that’s the right move” Professor D said “take a break. I’m confident we’ll figure this out, and you’re so close. You deserve a night off and bet this will all seem a lot more fixable with fresh eyes.”

Savannah nodded, and felt Mia sit beside her and give her a hug. She leaned into her and put her head on her shoulder as they made the long trek across the lake back towards the dock.

## Chapter 10

Savannah walked through the lobby and towards the gallery space, marveling at how big, clean and empty the university seemed at night. She was supposed to meet Mia at the gallery at 7:30, and she’d taken the day to relax, catch up with Jamie back home, and then get ready. 

She’d never really been good at getting dressed up, and her dad wasn’t much help in that department. Usually she’d lean on Jamie for help with something like this, but she certainly hadn’t brought anything that would be right to wear to an elegant art opening and cocktail party with a cyberpunk flair, whatever that meant. She’d thrown together a comfy green dress over some opaque leggings and brushed out her red hair, marveling at how long it was getting again already. She decided to leave it down out of her typical ponytail for once, and she felt it flow in the cool air conditioning of the hallway as she walked. 

It felt good to get out, and to be thinking about something other than her quest to find the treasure under the lake, especially with all the recent setbacks. She was questioning whether she should give it all up at this point and just get ready to go to college in a few weeks. 

Tonight though, she resolved that she would take her mind off it, and support Mia. Savannah figured it would be a bit stuffy and boring, and she'd find her way back to her borrowed dorm room soon enough. 

As she walked through the door to the gallery space, what greeted her was anything but what she expected. Despite seeing Mia work on her art installation for the past few weeks, Savannah hadn't really comprehended the scale of it. She entered a glowing room and saw at least 50 of the waving tendrils, each one as thick as a telephone pole, slowing waving gently as air passed up through them. Individually they looked a bit like crazy waving inflatable arm men, but together it truly did look like the inside of some massive underwater sea creature. 

She heard Mia scream "Savannah!" from the other side of the room, and she came bounding up to her, full of excitement. “You look great!” Mia said, taking her in for a moment.

“Oh my god. Mia, this is amazing, is so huge" 

"Here, come here, try it out before the line starts" Mia said, taking Savannah's hands, and leading her to the center of the room, directly in the middle of the sea of tendrils.

As Savannah stood there, a red spotlight turned on and shined down on her and Mia left her standing alone in the center as the rest of the room dimmed and quieted, the tendrils of the anemone around her settling down, gently wafting as the air slowly pushed up through then.

Savannah felt a little nervous being in the spotlight, and took a deep breath. She jumped a bit as the entire room, all the tendrils and lights, seemed to breathe at the exact same moment she did. An orange, pulsing light flowed up from the base of the tendrils as the air pushed them higher, and Savannah put her hand over her heart. She could feel her heartbeat pulse in the exact same rhythm as the lights inside them.

She laughed, and then tried to calm herself, feeling the room ebb and pulse with her. She breathed again, and all the tendrils lifted, and then sagged as she exhaled. She watched it for a few moments, marveling at the beauty of it. As she breathed in, it actually started a wave of action from the front of the room towards her. She felt some of the tendrils closest to her brush her arms and shoulders as the stood on end. She exhaled and watched as they deflated, again from the front of the room on towards her. She held her breath as she breathed out, and they all calmed, and then deflated, laying down and dimming, leaving the room with just her rhythmic red pulse flowing through it. 

Savannah began to lose herself in the moment, and took another huge breath and long exhale, feeling her control over the room. This felt like magic. She kept breathing deep, in-out, in-out as the room rose and fell with her, and she felt exhilarated as the oxygen flowed through her and her shoulders relaxed. Suddenly, she took a massively deep breath, and feeling almost compelled, let out a guttural yell. 

The room reacted instantly, a massive wall of neon pink flashing tendrils instantly blasted upwards at the far wall, waving crazily. The wave of light, the sound of the fans blasting full, and the wind escaping from the tendrils all marched quickly towards Savannah, washing over her as she yelled. Her eyes widened as the tidal wave of senses washed across the room towards and then over her, and she managed to say “oh!” and then laughed as it passed. Little waves of blue-green washed through the room echoing her surprised exclamation and laugh. 

“Mia!” Savannah exclaimed, looking over at her friend, watching all of it happen. Again the room began a pulsewave of light and tendrils that matched her voice, and it washed towards Savannah.

“Eeeee!” Mia exclaimed, and ran towards Savannah and hugged her excitedly. “So you like it?”

“This is absolutely incredible. I feel like a sorceress. It’s so fluid, I feel like I could command all of it.” Savannah said, watching the room continue to undulate with her breath and voice. 

“You’re not even that far off.” Mia said with a smile and a bit of a twinkle in her eye. “Do you sing?”

“Umm. Like, only for my Dad, or in the shower.”

Mia smiled at Savannah and then gestured around. “There’s no one else here yet, just you and me. Try singing to the room.”

Savannah looked at her nervously, and it was obvious that her heart started racing a bit, as the pulsing lights of the room quickened. Mia looked around and the lights gave Savannah a look. 

“Oh stop it. I’m sure you sing fine. Here watch, I’m not even good.”

Mia stood next to Savannah and faced the cameras and sensors at the front of the room, and began to sing a series of rising “ah”s, mimicking Ariel’s song from The Little Mermaid. As she sang, the tendrils waved to life but not as uniformly as before. Now it seemed that they had more of a flow to them, and as Mia held the note, the bottoms of the tendrils turned blue green, as if half underwater. The effect was magical, and when she stopped, the wave of light continued on out of the room. 

Savannah stood there slack-jawed at this beautiful thing her friend had created. 

Mia looked at her again and bopped her lightly on the arm. ‘Now, sing for me. First thing that comes to your mind. Go.”

Savannah took moment and then a deep breath, closed her eyes and began singing. Mia scooted back to the side of the room where she could watch and listen, biting her lip and bouncing on the balls of her feet with excitement. 

“As I went down in the river to pray” Savannah started singing slowly, and once again the room awoke in fluid motion, a current of light and motion that looked like water flowing by her feet and the waving tendrils beginning to dance above it. 

“Studying about that good old way” Savannah continued, and heard her voice echo back from the room with an etherial reverb. 

“What!?” Mia exclaimed, hearing Savannah’s voice, and clearly amazed she could sing like that. Mia’s outburst triggered a wave of motion in the room and she quickly covered her own mouth and motioned excitedly for Savannah to keep going. Savannah felt herself blush at Mia’s excitement, and as she heard the room echo her voice as it danced. She sounded good, and she felt the power of her control over the room again. 

“And who shall wear the starry crown, good lord, show me the way!” She continued the verse, gaining confidence and volume. 

“O sinners, let's go down! Let's go down, won’t you come on down.” And the room rose up into a waving, rhythmic dance matching her beautiful voice which continued to swirl around her, creating an incredible swell of light, motion and sound, picking up on Savannah’s notes and adding it’s own. 

Savannah slowed down and sang the final line quieter, willing the room to slow and quiet with her. “Oh sinners, let’s go down, down to the river and pray.” She held the last note quietly for a moment, and the room quieted as well, the music and echo of her voice fading as it all finally fell quiet and still, leaving only her breath and heart once more. 

Mia made a gesture with her hand, and finally, even the breathing and heartbeat of the room stopped, the tendrils lay down on the floor, and a soft white light shone from the ceiling. 

With the system off, it seemed as if the spell was broken, and Savannah was once again in a room with a bunch of fabric and fans and LEDs. It felt almost jarring after what she’d just experienced. 

Mia walked towards her, and Savanah could see her cheeks were wet. “Jesus girl, you can sing like that and you save it for the shower? Wow.” 

“Nevermind the singing, Mia, this is… I don’t even know what to say. That was one of the most moving things I’ve ever experienced. I want to live in here.”

Haha yeah I know what you mean, sometimes when I’m coding on it I just like to come sit here among all the tendrils as they dance. It’s cosy. 

I believe it, it’s amazing. You’ve made something beautiful here. 

Thanks. I’m glad you like it, and later, we’re talking about that singing voice of yours - I’ve got some tracks I’d love to get vocals on. But tonight’s your night to go have some fun, I’ll be running the installation until about 11, but professor D and the rest of the crew will be hanging out in the back gallery space. You can meet some of the other professors and kids from the school of tech, but just promise me you’ll stay until after I’m done with the show, okay?

Okay, and Mia, thanks. 

Thank you, if I can get even one reaction like you just had with my art, I’ve done my job. 

I’m sure you’ll get a lot more than just mine, Mia, this is incredible. I can see there’s a line starting, I’ll let you get to it. Have a blast and enjoy your night.

Thanks, I will. 

Savannah made her way out of the main space towards the gallery reception area, where art of various kinds hung on the walls, and people stood milling around and chatting. There were little trays of food being brought around, and Savannah slowly explored the space, enjoying the art and snacking on the appetizers as they were brought around. Eventually she made her way over to the main buffet table and grabbed a drink and a plate of finger food, but she wasn’t quite sure what to do with herself. She he’d been to enough events with her dad that she was fine being a wallflower while the adults chatted. Savannah hung near the doorway, and watched as folks filtered in, grouping in what she assumed were little cliques by department or friend group. She listened in and got a sense for which adults the students addressed as professor or doctor, and which ones the students were eager to talk to and who they just said hi to and avoided. 

It was fascinating to watch the two groups blend. In High School, the students and teachers wouldn’t ever really interact outside of the classroom or club, but here they were standing around and chatting. She heard a peal of laughter ring out from one of the clusters and the whole group seemed to be having a really great time as Dr Shivani (who apparently ran the art department) told some story to great effect.  

“A little overwhelming?” Savannah heard a voice to her left say, quietly. 

She looked over and saw Professor D standing along side her, also looking out at the crowd. 

“No, it’s not that. I don’t mind crowds actually, I feel kind of at home in them. I just like to watch sometimes, you know?”

“Totally, I love people watching. It’s my favorite thing to do when I go to the city. Sometimes you catch little snippets of conversations, or a funny interaction”

“Yeah, and I’ll try to imagine the backstory. Like, what was the drama that lead to that couple being mad on their date, or what’s the story with the old guy sitting alone”

“Exactly. I can fill hours with it.” The professor said, smiling at her. “So what’d you think of Mia’s installation, does she get the A+?”

“OMG professor D are you serious? Of course she does. It’s incredible. Did you sing?”

“Hahaha, no, definitely not, believe me, no one wants to hear that, but I did get a good gutteral yell out. It felt good, and wow when that room came alive as I screamed, I felt like an X-Man.”

“I assume that’s a superhero?”

“Ugh, I forget how old I’m getting - or how young you kids are. The X-men are technically mutants, but yes, superpowers and such. The interesting thing is they’re all a bunch of misfits who get chased out of regular society, and band together to learn how to control their powers and protect each other.”

“That sounds… familiar” Savannah said, smiling at the Professor.

Professor D squinted a bit and thought. “Hmm, yeah, also they all live at a school and their mentor is a guy called Professor X”

Savannah laughter and Professor D broke into a big smile.

“Okay, so this is like… barely a metaphor at this point, huh”

“Haha, yeah, I guess more of an inspiration. Speaking of, let’s go join up with the rest of our band of misfits, huh?”

“Lead on professor”

 —-
Savannah and Professor D spent the next few hours chatting with other kids from the space and various other members of the faculty and community. The more time spent with them the more Savannah felt at ease. After a few hours, the faculty started to filter out, leaving only the kids Savannah knew from the space, their friends, and a small group of professor D’s friends. 

Savannah felt her eyes getting heavy. It had been a long and emotional week leading up to their first outing on the boat, and being out and social was fun but she was starting to get tried. 

Mia noticed her along the edges of the party and came over to her, leaning against the wall with her.

“So what do you think?”

“This was so great. Thank you for getting me out - I needed to get out of my head and I still can’t believe how awesome your piece is. The party’s been pretty nice too” Savannah said, smiling. 

Mia smiled at her, with a twinkle in her eye. “Oh sweety. This wasn’t the party. This was the dog and pony show for the normies and the school’s donors. Just give it 30 more minutes okay? Promise me you won’t go anywhere?”

“What happens in 30 minutes” Savannah asked, not quite understanding, but picking up on Mia’s enthusiasm. 

“You’ll see. Just hang on a little longer okay? For me?” Mia asked, taking Savannah’s hand and giving it a squeeze. 

Savannah felt her heart skip a little as she looked at Mia’s expectant face, and she felt herself blushing. 

“Okay” she heard herself say, and Mia made a “sqeee” sound and pulled her into a hug, bouncing with excitement. 

For a moment, the world disappeared. Mia was pure energy and excitement tonight, and as she squeezed Savannah hard she felt her flush deepen. It felt like there was a little crackle of electricity between them as they pressed close and Savannah felt herself instinctively press back towards Mia. 

Mia pulled away gently, giving Savannah a knowing look, and then a wide smile as her cheeks turned red as well. A beat passed, and the she said “It’s going to be worth it. Trust me!”. She pulled away, holding savannahs hand until the last second 

As Mia let go and returned to the crowd, Savannah finally felt herself breathe. She hadn’t realized she’d been holding her breath. 

She felt giggly and lightheaded. She hadn’t realized she liked Mia. In fact, Savannah hadn’t ever quite had a crush like this. She’d liked some boys in school. And the occasional girl, but she’d never had time for any of it while taking care of her dad and then everything after he passed

This was different though. This felt immediate, and urgent. All she wanted to do was be close to Mia again and get that feeling of touching lightning back. 

Savannah lost herself for a little while, smiling like an idiot, watching Mia flit from her person to person, working the crowd. Savannah pressed her hand to her mouth, trying to cover the grin that kept creeping across her face.

She didn’t even notice Marco slide in next to her. He looked at her, then followed her gaze as she stared at Mia, then made an over dramatic show of doing a double take between them. 

When Savannah finally noticed him, Marco was making a stupid face at her, gawking back and forth between her and Mia.

“Oh shut up” Savannah said, giving his arm a smack

“Damn, you got it bad huh?”

“Is it that obvious?”

He gave her a deadpan stare. “You’ve got like, anime sparkles in your eyes. It’s ridiculous.”

Savannah bit her lower lip and looked sideways at him. “Do you think she…” and before she finished Marco was rolling his eyes and nearly falling over

“Ugh, Savannah, are you for real? Have you seriously not noticed? She’s been flirting with you for WEEKS. My god girl, you’ve gotta work on your observation skills”

Marco went on, but Savannah didn’t hear him. She felt another wave of warmth and excitement rush through her and smiled again. 

This time, Mia caught her looking and gave her a shy smile across the floor of the space, tucking her hair behind her ear and laughing in a way that made Savannah go a little weak at the knees

“Wow. You didn’t hear a word of that did you?”

“What?” Savannah said, realizing Marco was still talking to her. 

“You’re ridiculous. Adorable, but ridiculous” he said, laughing. “I’ve gotta help Professor d close up, but you better save a dance for me.”

“Okay” Savannah said, still slightly distracted, as Marco strode back into the thinning crowd. “Wait, what dance?” She called after him, but he couldn’t hear her or didn’t answer. 

A few minutes later, Professor D grabbed a mic and stood on one of the speakers, playing the role of emcee. “Okay, for everyone still here, thank you! Thank you for supporting our space, our students, and their amazing art. Speaking of, how about a big round of applause for Mia Thompson’s amazing showcase tonight?!” He yelled, and was greeted by a raucous chorus of “yeahs!” And “whoos!” 

Savannah watched Mia blush and smile as the crowd cheered her, and she smiled and waved a bit. Prof D went on about the makerspace and the program a bit,. but Savannah wasn’t listening. All she could see was Mia making her way over to her. 

Mia slid in next to her against the wall again, bumping into her with her shoulder and giving her a cute side eye. 

Savannah pushed her back slightly, and felt herself flush again as Mia hooked her arm through hers and stayed hooked to her as the professor finished his speech. 

Another chorus of cheers rose up from the crowd as he wrapped up, and Savannah and Mia joined in with the yells, and as the crowd died down, the music turned down as well, and the lights came up. It felt like the end of the night after prom, and the rest of the adults found their stuff and filtered out while kids from the program milled about, clearing tables away and cleaning up empty plates and cups. 

Mia though stayed glued to Savannah’s side. Her arm slid down along Savannah’s until their fingers intertwined. 

A minute or two passed, and Savannah wondered if she should start to help the others clean up, but she felt Mia’s warm arm against hers and just squeezed her hand and leaned into her. Whatever this was, it was too nice to interrupt. 

“Are all the muggles gone?” Savannah heard Marco yell from somewhere near the DJ booth. 

Professor D called back from the door. “All clear” 

The crowd of remaining students and professor D’s friends all cheered again, surprising savannah. 

“All right!” Marco yelled “Ready? Five… Four…” He started counting down, and everyone joined in. Savanah looked quizzically at Mia, who was now looking at her like the cat that caught the canary as she yelled along with them. “Three, two” Mia yelled as she started backing towards the center of the room, pulling Savanah along with her. “One!” They all yelled, and suddenly the room transformed.

The beat after the countdown, the lights went out, Mia’s art came to life, and a thumping beat started. 

“What!?” Savannah shouted after Mia, as she was now dragging her onto what had instantly turned into a dance floor in the middle of a wild rave. Everyone was jumping and dancing as lights flashed, and lasers blazed across the air above them. Mia just cackled and dragged Savannah into the center of it. 

She turned to Savannah, dancing and singing along to the music, and Savannah felt the last of her inhibitions melt away. She threw her head back and laughed, and then began dancing as well. Wild, gangly movements, bouncing and jumping to the electronic dance beats that Marco was pumping out from the DJ station in an endless, seamless stream. 

As they danced, Mia and Savannah circled eachother, sometimes bumping into others on the floor and dancing with them as well, but they seemed to be attached by an invisible wire that kept dragging them together. 

Savannah lost herself to the night, letting her anxieties and worries melt away as she moved to the music. Mia disappeared for a minute only to return with a much needed drink. She smelled the telltale sting of alcohol wafting off it, and looked first at Mia and then at Professor D. 

Mia moved close to her, and she could feel her breath hot on her ear as she spoke

“It’s okay, he doesn’t care as long as he doesn’t see it. I can grab you a water if you want…”

But savannah just locked eyes with Mia and drank, feeling the light burn of the spiked punch as it went down. She’d never really drank before - she’d tried her dad beer once but it tasted gross and she didn’t feel anything. Tonight, all she wanted to do was feel. 

As she felt it travel down her parched throat, it seemed to spark a whole new wave of warmth through her, and she closed her eyes and let her head ease back as she danced. 

She reached out for Mia who took her hand. She was sweaty and flushed and gleaming in the lights as the flashed. 

Mia pulled her closer again as they danced next to, and then against one another. She felt her hips press forward of their own accord, and she was grinding against Mia now as they gyrated to the music. 

She wasn’t sure who kissed who, but there was no stopping it once they started. Savannah sank into Mia and felt the freedom and the warmth, and the music, and the blazing heat of her need all at once. 

The rest of the night was a blur, like snippets of wild abandon and bliss set in a backdrop that felt totally alien and like the home she’d been looking for at the same time. 

Dancing under a laser light show, sneaking off with Mia into her art and making out hidden among the waving arms of her anemone, singing at the top of their lungs as the music turned to pop and dance anthems of her younger years. 

Eventually the night came to a close, and Savannah found herself leaning on Marco as they walked out of the space together.

“You’ll make sure she gets to the dorm okay?” Mia asked Marco, after giving Savannah a parting kiss 

“I’ve got her.” Savannah heard Marco say, as she gazed up at the pristine, cloudless night sky. 

As they walked to the dorm with her arm over his shoulders, Savannah could see the outline of the Milky Way, clear behind the bright stars, and she was struck by the beauty of it. She felt safe, and euphoric, and completely at peace.

Marco walked her in and she immediately kicked her shoes off and climbed into her bed without even taking her dress off. It felt like the softest thing in the world. 

“Thank you.” She said. “Thank you for everything. I needed this. All of this” 

“We’ve got you, kiddo” he said, handing her a glass of water to drink. “You’re one of us now. We take care of our own”

Savannah drank the water, and snuggled down into her bed, and felt Marco pull the comforter up over her. 

She was asleep in an instant.

## Work in progress notes
## Summary so far
Savannah is a red-haired teenager who embarks on a treasure hunting adventure based on her late father's research. He had been obsessed with solving a cryptic riddle tied to a cryptocurrency, known as BUTI, which was linked to a real-world treasure hunt set up by an anonymous crypto enthusiast, Captain Flint. Savannah's friend Jamie decides to stay behind in their hometown, but promises to help Savannah remotely. Savannah hits the road and travels to a massive lake in Georgia, the location specified in her father's notes. Her father believed that the crypto treasure was somehow linked to the old senator, Strom Thurmond, whose dam and lake had been renamed as Clark Hill. After feeling lost and questioning the sanity of her journey, Savannah breaks down and reaches out to Jamie, who encourages her to push on and continue investigating the clues. With Jamie's remote support, Savannah further investigates the links between the treasure, the senator, and the movie "O’ Brother Where Art Thou" — a film she and her father had often watched together. At the Clark Hill visitor's center, Savannah discovers an NFC tag hidden beneath a plaque, which leads her to a page asking for a password. When she correctly enters "Odyssey", the page changes and reveals that the final treasure lies beneath the lake, accessible only with the help of an underwater drone whose plans are attached. Savannah and Jamie are exhilarated and vow to continue their adventure, despite the challenge of needing to build the drone. Savannah, accompanied remotely by her friend Jamie and a group of newfound friends from the Georgia Cyber Center's makerspace, embarks on her treasure hunting adventure. The group gathers at the makerspace, where Savannah shares her story and the plans for the submarine drone she needs to build to find the hidden NFC tag under Clark Hill Lake.
Excitement builds among the group as they analyze the blueprints and discuss the possibilities. Professor D, the head of the makerspace, suggests that the summer cohort work on the project together, offering their assistance and knowledge. Savannah, feeling a sense of belonging and trust, agrees to let them join her on the treasure hunt.The group divides the tasks and begins working on building the submarine drone. They break down the problem into smaller components and start tackling them one by one. Savannah is grateful for the support and expertise of her new friends and feels more confident in her ability to complete the adventure.
With their combined skills and determination, Savannah and her team continue their quest to build the drone and find the hidden treasure. They laugh, joke, and form a strong bond while working together, making the journey even more enjoyable.


Savannah joins forces with a group of newfound friends from the Georgia Cyber Center's makerspace to build the drone. With Professor D's guidance, the group divides tasks and starts working on the project. Mia, another member of the group, showcases her interactive art installation called the “breathing room.” Savannah and Liam, a skilled member of the group, collaborate on programming and assembling the drone. In Chapter 6, the group works together in the makerspace. Mia shares her art project, and Liam assists Savannah in programming the drone. They discuss the challenges of finding specific parts, but Liam introduces an alternative board, the Adapute, that simplifies their battery and control system. They successfully test the rudders' movements and make progress in assembling the drone.Savannah reconnects with Jamie, discussing their recent experiences. Savannah shares her excitement about the progress with the drone and her involvement with the Georgia Cyber Center. They catch up on personal matters, and Savannah feels a growing sense of independence on her treasure hunt. She reflects on the change in her life and focuses on her quest to solve the remaining puzzles and find the treasure. Chapter 8 highlights the final pool test of the underwater drone. Savannah, Mateo, and Liam, along with the support of Professor D and his class, successfully navigate the sub to locate RFID beacons in the pool. They celebrate their achievement and Professor D offers to join Savannah on her search for the treasure. Savannah is touched by their dedication and prepares to set out on the boat, accompanied by her newfound friends. As the story progresses, Savannah's treasure hunting adventure brings her closer to uncovering the secrets tied to her father's research. With the support of her friends and mentors, she faces challenges, learns new skills, and builds strong bonds along the way. The anticipation builds as Savannah prepares to embark on her search for the final treasure hidden beneath the lake.

OBSTACLE: The lake is big, the sub is faulty, kids are going home, Liam gets seasick. It’s falling apart. 



BEAT
Making the sub:
Savannah makes friends at a the Georgia Cyber Center / Innovation Space. 

They’re nice and helpful, but this is a big project. Savannah’s going to have to hunker down for a bit. They get some of the parts ordered, but they’ll have to keep hunting for others. 

CHARACTERS:
Mateo - 23 and runs the shop
Professor D - faculty sponsor, avuncular and wants Savannah to consider applying
Mia - 21 y/o undergrad, on an interactive art piece with inflatables
Liam - basically just tags along after Mateo, clearly has a crush and isn’t shy about it
Riley - Junior - hardware whiz, electrical eng and working on a circuit board, Savannah reminds the crew of her 
Demi - Nonbianry

OBJECTIVE: Build the sub
OBSTACLE: Out of production parts
SOLUTIONS: harvesting things at hack nights. Old projects, etc. She gets a motor controller and an the stepper motors from an old 3D printer, but they need a microcontroller and they can’t find one old enough that has WiFi and runs the version of Arduino the original code was in. 

Adapute board does WiFi and circuitpython, and they start to port the code.

They do a test run in the Olympic sized pool on campus (#RESEARCH: is there a campus and a pool?)

Seems to be working, someone comes 
up with clever booster for NFC reader. 

It takes on a little water so the	

Out on a boat, they get it
First puzzle complete, clues for 2 unlocked

#RESEARCH data transmission underwater - do we need something other than ESP32 wifi?
 yes this is going to be a hydrophone using a series of backscatter sensors for both reception and transmission
